# "Experience"
Currently engaged in cross-functional deployment of vaguely useful abstractions through the Institute of Modular Overengineering. Previously a semi-autonomous unit within the Bureau of Recursive Syntax and Contextual Reinvention. Once led a scrum of rogue React components into semantic compliance.

# Ongoing Research Areas

- Aggressively componentized emotional state management (React, but make it existential)
- Trying to learn how machines learn, without accidentally achieving sentience
- SQL incantations that SELECT inner peace FROM chaos
- Pythonic codebases where indentation is sacred and bugs are hunted with reverence

## About Me
I build things. Sometimes they even work.
If your project needs results that are real and poetic in complexity, check the repos.

Doing all this until the day I can adopt the bear hibernation model: six months of deep rest, six months of focused productivity, zero emails throughout.
