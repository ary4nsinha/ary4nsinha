# Aryan Sinha

I write code that delivers- functional, and ready to ship. Proficient in React, Python, TensorFlow, and SQL, I like to build solutions that people use and enjoy.

## Tech Stack
- **React**: Spinning up UIs faster than you can say "all of frontend is over-engineered slop"
- **Python**: Scripts and logic that don’t choke on a missing `__init__.py`.
- **TensorFlow**: Training models without summoning NaN demons.
- **SQL**: Queries so optimized, they’d make a DBA weep.
- **Java**: Only when I’m stuck in legacy purgatory.

## About Me
- I like to read deep into subjects, ideas and systems.
- Driven by challenges, I’m all about delivering results that hold up.
